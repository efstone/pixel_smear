# Pixel Smear
This app lets you open an image, and then move your cursor over the image and see horizontal bands of pixels corresponding to the vertical column of pixels at the location of your cursor.

I got the idea when I saw a printing error one time. A large inkjet printer begin printing an image, and then there was a glitch, causing the printhead to repeat the same row over and over for the remainder of the page. It was strangely beautiful! I have re-created this effect several times in Photoshop and I thought it might be neat to see the effect happen in realtime. I had also been wanting to do more GUI stuff with Python, so this seemed like a good starting place. (Normally I just do backend work with Pythonâ€¦ And web apps with Django.)
